Swami Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta in Kolkata on 12 January 1863. He was a brilliant student who excelled in various subjects, including music, art, literature and philosophy. He was also interested in spirituality and practiced meditation and yoga from a young age. He was influenced by his father, who was a lawyer and a rationalist, and his mother, who was a devout Hindu.
 
At the age of 18, Vivekananda joined the Presidency College in Kolkata, where he studied Western philosophy and science. He also became a member of the Brahmo Samaj, a reformist movement that challenged the orthodox practices of Hinduism. He was impressed by the teachings of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Keshab Chandra Sen, who advocated for social justice and human dignity.
 
However, Vivekananda was not satisfied with the intellectual approach of the Brahmo Samaj. He wanted to have a direct experience of God and the truth of religion. He started searching for a guru who could guide him in his spiritual quest. He met several religious leaders and scholars, but none of them could satisfy his thirst for knowledge.
  
In 1881, Vivekananda met Ramakrishna, a saint and mystic who lived at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Ramakrishna recognized Vivekananda as his spiritual heir and initiated him into the path of Advaita Vedanta, the philosophy of non-dualism. Ramakrishna taught Vivekananda that all religions are true and lead to the same goal of realizing one's true nature as Brahman, the Absolute Reality. He also instructed Vivekananda to serve humanity as a manifestation of God.
 
Vivekananda was initially skeptical of Ramakrishna's claims and tested him with various questions and arguments. He also challenged Ramakrishna's devotion to the goddess Kali, whom he considered a mere idol. However, after witnessing Ramakrishna's ecstatic states and experiencing his unconditional love, Vivekananda gradually surrendered to him and accepted him as his guru. He also had several mystical experiences under Ramakrishna's guidance that convinced him of the validity of Vedanta.
 
After Ramakrishna's death in 1886, Vivekananda and his fellow disciples took monastic vows and formed the first monastic order of Ramakrishna. They established a monastery at Baranagar, where they practiced meditation, studied scriptures and served the poor. Vivekananda emerged as the leader of the group and took charge of spreading Ramakrishna's message to the world. He traveled extensively throughout India, delivering inspiring speeches and awakening the masses to their spiritual potential.
